# Talk's slides

Although I cannot call myself a "public speaker", I would like to keep track of
the talks I have shared in the past. Within this repository, you can find:

- Slides I have written in Markdown notation
- Links to presentations I have created using other platforms (i.e.: Google Slides)

All of those can be found [over here](https://jossemargt.github.io/talks/static/).

## How does it process the MD files?

1. Write the presentation in markdown notation.
2. `make`
3. ???
4. Profit!
