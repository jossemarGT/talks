# Talks index

While I wouldnâ€™t consider myself a "public speaker", I want to keep a record of
the talks I have given in the past. [Here](https://jossemargt.github.io/talks/),
you will find:

- Slides I have created in Markdown notation
- Links to presentations I have developed using other platforms, such as Google Slides

## How does it process the MD files?

1. Write the presentation in markdown notation.
2. `make`
3. ???
4. Profit!
