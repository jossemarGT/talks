# My pandoc (transformed) slides

On this repository you can find slides I have created for past talks and written
in Markdown notation.

Eeyup, these are post-processed using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and
published as static pages
[over here](https://jossemargt.github.io/pandoc-slides/static/).

## How does it work?

1. Write presentation in markdown notation.
2. `make`
3. ???
4. Profit!
